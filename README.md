# A Better Statistical Model of Auditory Brain Responses (ABR): Similarity vs. Averaging
## Malcolm Slaney, Emily Kuo, George Liu, Dáibhid Ó Maoiléidigh

This is the code and results to support our work on detecting ABR signals
using inter-trial similarity.

This repository contains:
 * analyze.py - Code to analyze an ABR experiment
 * analyze_test.py - Test code for analysis softeare
 * bidelman.py - Code to create colored-noise summary from Bidelman's data
 * simulation.py - Code to create the simulations and plots of our theory
 *
 * ABR Covaraince 2026 ARO Poster.pdf - The poster from the 2026 Midwinter Meeting
 * Results - A directory containing the rendered plots.
 *     covariance_cache* - Cache of simulated data
 *     *.png - Simulation results
