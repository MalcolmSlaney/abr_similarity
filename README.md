# A Better Statistical Model of Auditory Brain Responses (ABR): Similarity vs. Averaging
## Malcolm Slaney, Emily Kuo, George Liu, Dáibhid Ó Maoiléidigh

This is the code and results to support our work on detecting ABR signals
using inter-trial similarity.

This repository contains:
 * simulation.py - Code to create the simulations and plots of our theory
 * bidelman.py - Code to create colored-noise summary
 * analyze.py - To be done - Code to analyze an ABR experiment
 * ABR Covaraince 2026 ARO Poster.pdf - The poster from the 2026 Midwinter Meeting
 * covariance_cache* - Cache of experimental results
 * Plots - A directory containing the rendered plots.
